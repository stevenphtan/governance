# SODA Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The SODA TSC is the technical governing body of the CNCF Foundation. It admits and oversees all projects in the SODA Foundation and has a mandate to facilitate driving neutral consensus for:
* defining and maintaining the technical vision for the SODA Foundation,
* approving new projects within the scope for SODA set by the Governing Board (GB), and create a conceptual architecture for the projects, aligning projects, removing or archiving projects,
* accepting feedback from end user committee and map to projects,
* aligning interfaces to components under management (code reference implementations before standardizing), and defining common practices to be implemented across SODA projects, if any.
